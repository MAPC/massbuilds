The CR has been submitted to the BOS, and will be presented to the Conservation Commission, to be held by the Carlisle Conservation Foundation (CCF). The applicant?s agents will also be informing the Town of Acton about these plans as well as the State.

The existing building at 571 Union Avenue will be renovated, and a new entry way and elevator will be added as shown on the plans so that the building will be handicapped accessible.  The entire building will be converted to medical use.   The existing parking lot will be reconstructed.  The existing pavement will be reclaimed to the maximum extent feasible.  Work includes removing some paved area closest to the Sudbury River, constructing a new drainage system, including a detention area, constructing new curb cuts along Union Avenue, and increasing the amount of landscaped areas along the site boundaries and within the parking lot.   The gross floor area ratio of buildings on the site will be reduced from approximately 0.35 existing to 0.30 proposed.  The landscaped surface ratio will also be increased.  There are currently 89 off-street parking spaces on the site, although not all conform to current standards.

The East Framingham Sewer Improvement Project (EFSIP) includes the construction of a new gravity sewer on Concord Street from Old Connecticut Path to Arthur Street and within the former railroad right-of-way from Speen Street to School Street.  It also includes the construction of a new force main sewer from A Street to Old Connecticut Path.  This project will eliminate three sewer pump stations and several miles of force main, one of the largest contributors of sulfides in the Town’s sewer system.  In addition, this project will eliminate several sanitary sewer overflows which constitute Clean Water Act violations and pose a threat to human health and the environment.  The North Concord Street Water Main will be replaced in conjunction with the sewer work.  The North Concord Street Water Main consists of approximately 14,000 feet of various diameter pipes and is undersized throughout most of its length.  The pipe has out lived its useful life and provides insufficient fire flow capacity.  In addition to the utility work, this project will develop the former railroad right-of-way into a recreational pathway that will also allow for operational access to the sewer pipe.  This work includes the construction of a new multi-use trail beginning at the northern terminus located at School Street, continuing along the abandoned railroad corridor before terminating at Cochituate Road (Route 30), a distance of approximately 1.5 miles.  The work includes a new hot mix bituminous asphalt trail, trail pull-offs, construction of two new pre-engineered bridges, an at-grade crossing of Old Connecticut Path, a crossing of the TJX entrance and a crossing of the Luchetti driveway.  Completion of the EFSIP improvements is required under the terms of the Administrative Consent Order (ACO) with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MADEP).  The sewer work proposed under this project has been preliminarily approved for low interest loans under the MADEP State Revolving Fund (SRF).  The project is also eligible for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) stimulus funding provided that the construction contracts are in place prior to February 17, 2010.  The new Wastewater Management Facility (WWMF) will convey up to 13 million gallons per day of wastewater from north Framingham to the MWRA discharge location on Arthur Street.  A significant amount of this wastewater is generated from Route 9 and the Saxonville area.  Therefore, approximately half of the wastewater flow managed by the facility is generated in areas south of the Sudbury River.  This wastewater must be gravity conveyed to the WWMF and then pumped back under the river to Arthur Street.  If the WWMF is situated south of the river, then the total amount of wastewater crossing the Sudbury River is reduced by 2/3rds.  Reducing that amount of flow crossing the Sudbury River reduces the Town’s liability should a system failure result in the discharge of untreated wastewater to this important and sensitive environmental resource.  Also, if the WWMF was situated north of the river, then it would be necessary to convey the wastewater using a siphon and force main piping.  These structures are vulnerable and prone to failure compared to open channel gravity piping.  If the WWMF is situated south of the river, then the reduced wastewater flow crossing the river will convey through open channel gravity piping.  The facility was sited based on a thorough alternatives analysis.  In addition to significantly reducing the amount of wastewater that crosses the Sudbury River, sitting the facility on the south side of the river eliminates the need for a siphon which would be problematic to maintain.  The ability to eliminate the Speen Street pump station could also only be accomplished if the proposed WWMF is located within a very narrow geographical area that meets the topographical constraints to allow gravity flow from the existing Speen Street station to Saxonville.  In addition to meeting the topographical constraints, the proposed location does not require the acquisition of any non-town owned property.  Locating the facility closer to the High School parking lot was considered, but the construction and operability issues associated with making the wetwell even deeper make that infeasible.

The addition, as shown on the Plan, is located within the front setback, however, as noted, approval has been received from the Zoning Board of Appeals for the location of the expansion.  In addition to the expansion, additional space is being added as a result of the expansion of the second floor.   The second floor was expanded approximately 8 feet along the front of the building.  The total area of the addition and the second floor (346 square feet) results in a total increase of 3,840 square feet.  The second floor is being converted to a function area with 90 seats accessed by the elevator being installed in the addition.  As a result of the changes to the Restaurant Lot, the building area increased from 10,644 square feet to 14,448 square feet, thereby establishing a Floor Area Ratio of .7,(existing F.A.R. of .52), as authorized by the Zoning Board of Appeals.  The changes will also result in an increase in the seating for the Restaurant patrons of 43 and an increase in the function seating for 4 patrons.

The changes to the Parking Lot also include the demolition of the existing automobile repair facility.   With the changes, the Open Space Area on the Parking Lot increases from .04 to .27.    Changes to the Parking Lot include the installation of a new drainage system, significant landscaping and the elimination of one driveway on Waverly Street.

The Plans also include the upgrading of the building facade.  Safety is also improved through the elimination of one of the driveways along Waverly Street.  In discussions of the Board, concerns were noted for the crossing of Waverly Street.  It was noted there is an existing street light in the area of the driveway and crossing area.  As a result of comments from the Planning Board, the Plan was revised to include Bollard lighting and signage to direct customers along the sidewalk to the crosswalk at the Winter Street intersection.
