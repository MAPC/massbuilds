## Setup Notes

Before running `bin/setup` you need to set three environment variables: `MASSBUILDS_DATABASE_USERNAME` so that the postgres foreign data wrapper knows your local database username when setting up the foreign data wrapper, and `FOREIGN_DATABASE_USERNAME` and `FOREIGN_DATABASE_PASSWORD` to comport with the username and password of your postgres foreign database.
