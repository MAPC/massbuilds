The project is  zoned Single Family Residental District (R-1).  Said parcel is shown on the Framingham Assessor's Sheet 276, Block 151, Lot 9.   The project is the construction of a wastewater Management Facility, approximately 9,600 square feet in size, with landscaping, parking, lighting, and drainage improvements on a parcel of land at 67 A Street.
The East Framingham Sewer Improvement Project (EFSIP) includes the construction of a new gravity sewer on Concord Street from Old Connecticut Path to Arthur Street and within the former railroad right-of-way from Speen Street to School Street.  It also includes the construction of a new force main sewer from A Street to Old Connecticut Path.  This project will eliminate three sewer pump stations and several miles of force main, one of the largest contributors of sulfides in the Town'ss sewer system.  In addition, this project will eliminate several sanitary sewer overflows which constitute Clean Water Act violations and pose a threat to human health and the environment.

In addition to the utility work, this project will develop the former railroad right-of-way into a recreational pathway that will also allow for operational access to the sewer pipe.  This work includes the construction of a new multi-use trail beginning at the northern terminus located at School Street, continuing along the abandoned railroad corridor before terminating at Cochituate Road (Route 30), a distance of approximately 1.5 miles.  The work includes a new hot mix bituminous asphalt trail, trail pull-offs, construction of two new pre-engineered bridges, an at-grade crossing of Old Connecticut Path, a crossing of the TJX entrance and a crossing of the Luchetti driveway.

Completion of the EFSIP improvements is required under the terms of the Administrative Consent Order (ACO) with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MADEP).  The sewer work proposed under this project has been preliminarily approved for low interest loans under the MADEP State Revolving Fund (SRF).  The project is also eligible for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) stimulus funding provided that the construction contracts are in place prior to February 17, 2010.

The facility was sited based on a thorough alternatives analysis.  In addition to significantly reducing the amount of wastewater that crosses the Sudbury River, sitting the facility on the south side of the river eliminates the need for a siphon which would be problematic to maintain.  The ability to eliminate the Speen Street pump station could also only be accomplished if the proposed WWMF is located within a very narrow geographical area that meets the topographical constraints to allow gravity flow from the existing Speen Street station to Saxonville.  In addition to meeting the topographical constraints, the proposed location does not require the acquisition of any non-town owned property.  Locating the facility closer to the High School parking lot was considered, but the construction and operability issues associated with making the wetwell even deeper make that infeasible.",,,M_208294_896720,2012,,,,1,,,http://massbuilds.com/developments/2091,1,2012-10-19 19:04:33.14+00,2017-03-01 20:12:22.634+00,3102

The project is zoned Restaurant use at the property located at 911 and 921 Waverly Street, zoned General Manufacturing (M) and to provide parking at 904 and 920 Waverly Street zoned Business (B).  The premises are shown on Framingham Assessors Plan Sheet 149, Block 306, Lots 3 and 4 and Sheet 124, Block 253, Lots 2 and 15.  the Plan includes the construction of an addition to the Restaurant facility.  The addition consists of approximately 3,494 square feet. In addition to the expansion, additional space is being added as a result of the expansion of the second floor.   The second floor was expanded approximately 8 feet along the front of the building.  The total area of the addition and the second floor (346 square feet) results in a total increase of 3,840 square feet.  The second floor is being converted to a function area with 90 seats accessed by the elevator being installed in the addition.

As a result of the changes to the Restaurant Lot, the building area increased from 10,644 square feet to 14,448 square feet, thereby establishing a Floor Area Ratio of .7,(existing F.A.R. of .52), as authorized by the Zoning Board of Appeals.  The changes will also result in an increase in the seating for the Restaurant patrons of 43 and an increase in the function seating for 4 patrons.

Changes to the property located at 904 and 920 Waverly Street (Parking Lot) are also proposed.  The design for the parking area of the Parking Lot is in full compliance of the By-Law.  The changes to the Parking Lot also include the demolition of the existing automobile repair facility.   With the changes, the Open Space Area on the Parking Lot increases from .04 to .27.    Changes to the Parking Lot include the installation of a new drainage system, significant landscaping and the elimination of one driveway on Waverly Street.

The totality of the changes to the site result in the Project being in compliance after the issuance of the Zoning Board of AppealsÃ¢â¬â¢ Decisions, with the requirements of the By-Law, except for the location of the parking spaces for the Restaurant Facility across Waverly Street and the need for a Special Permit for the increase in Restaurant Operations.  As depicted on the Site Plan, 122 parking spaces are provided for the Restaurant Operations, as modified, and the existing Barber Shop, as required under the By-Law.  The Plans also include the upgrading of the building facade.  Safety is also improved through the elimination of one of the driveways along Waverly Street.  In discussions of the Board, concerns were noted for the crossing of Waverly Street.  It was noted there is an existing street light in the area of the driveway and crossing area.  As a result of comments from the Planning Board, the Plan was revised to include Bollard lighting and signage to direct customers along the sidewalk to the crosswalk at the Winter Street intersection.  It was also noted that the Massachusetts Highway Department is in the process of making improvements to the Winter Street intersection and plans to move the crosswalk closer to the Restaurant Operations.",,,M_205303_891541,2012,Bus stop: Framingham,,,1,,,http://massbuilds.com/developments/2095,1,2012-10-19 19:36:32.311+00,2017-03-01 20:12:44.498+00,524
